	<p>STW, also known as Scientific and Technical Writing, is closely related to STEM and is also taught by
	<a href="http://www.massacademy.org/siobha03.html" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Ms. Curran</a>.
	This class is where more of the writing comes in play. We do our STEM project, but to present it we have to create a poster board and write a paper.</p>
	<p>In order to prepare us for it, Ms. Curran had us write a grant proposal. Our grant proposals were entered into a EngineerGirl Contest (Boys can participate too). My grant proposal is about the endangered Geoffrey Spider Monkeys. They live in Central America and are losing their habitats because of deforestation. I proposed that we create synthetic wood instead of cutting down trees. To look more into it, please read it
	<a href="pdf/SpiderMonkeyGrantProposal.pdf" target= "_blank" class="colorHover">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Because this is a science class, we also read a lot of science articles. After reading these articles, we often write short summaries on them. One of my
	<a href="pdf/CurrentEventArticle2.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorHover">summaries</a> is about how computer AIs are nice, but they can develop bad habits with exposure.
