		<p>If you didn't already know, STEM stands for Science,
			Technology, Engineering, and Math. Mass Academy is very STEM-focused.
			Everything comes back to STEM. Mass Academy gives us the opportunity
			to choose an individual project topic and work on it for the majority
			of A, B, and C term. We have mini-STEM fairs to show what we have
			done and can compete in the regional, state, and national fairs as
			well.</p>
		<p>
			The main teacher who teaches us STEM is <a
				href="http://www.massacademy.org/siobha03.html" target="_blank"
				class="colorHover">Ms. Curran</a>. She teaches techniques that would
			help us in our STEM project, such as how to write papers and how to
			organize our board. STEM projects are your own individual work, which
			is great because you get to do something you want to do. We also get
			advisors who help us with our project more in depth. My advisor is <a
				href="http://www.massacademy.org/angela46.html" class="colorHover">Mrs.
				Taricco</a>.</p>

			My project is about electricity conservation. Consumers often waste
			electricity because they use their appliances inefficiently,
			contributing to the spread of global warming. I engineered a consumer
			extension of smart grid, a device which accurately monitors the
			electricity consumption of household appliances and educates
			consumers on how to use electricity efficiently. Smart grid is an
			innovative technology which helps utility companies monitor
			electricity generation and consumption and promotes the use of
			renewable energy in households to reduce the consumption of fossil
			fuels. </p>
		<p>
			The device, featuring a microcontroller and a current circuit,
			measures the consumerâ€™s electricity consumption safely and
			non-intrusively from the appliance wire. I also developed an app with
			the device to entice consumers to learn about their electricity
			consumption, such as a preferred amount of electricity to use and
			optimal times to use their appliances to minimize fossil fuel
			consumption. The device was tested on a variety of appliances with
			different energy efficiencies. I compared the measurements obtained
			by the device to measurements obtained from commercially available
			instruments. My device is extremely accurate. </p>
		<p>
			When utilized, this
			project increases consumer awareness and guides consumers to learn
			about and decrease their electricity consumption to reduce the
			effects of global warming. To learn more about my project, please
			read my <a href="pdf/FinalStemPaper.pdf" target="_blank"
				class="colorHover">paper</a> and look at my <a href="pdf/MSSEF.pdf"
				target="_blank" class="colorHover">poster board</a>.</p>

			Along with a poster board, I also set up an apparatus to show what my
			project did.</p>

		<p>After we complete our individual STEM project, we form teams to
			develop an aid for individuals with disabilites. This project carries
			on for the rest of the year. We partner with Seven Hills, a
			foundation that helps individuals with disabilities gain
			independence. My group decided to make a toothpaste dispenser. We
			were told that the current device costs an exorbitant amount. We
			decided we would build a cheaper and better prototype. The user
			complained of using only one toothpaste brand, so we designed the
			prototype to accept multiple toothpaste brands. Our prototype accepts
			Crest, Colgate, and Sensodyne. We 3D printed multiple prototypes and
			used a vacuum pump to dispense the toothpaste. The picture to the
			left shows our final prototype in vibrant yellow.</p>
