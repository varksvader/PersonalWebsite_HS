	<p>Math Modeling at Mass Academy is different from most traditional math classes taught at other high schools. We use our previous knowledge to solve problems in groups rather than sit down and take notes on lectures. </p>
	<p>One of the reasons why we have Math Modeling at Mass Academy is to help us prepare for the HiMCM, 
	<a href="http://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/" target="_blank" class="colorHover">High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling</a>. 
	The HiMCM is a competition where a group of 3-4 students work together to solve real-life problems using math. It is a 36 hour math competition, and there are no breaks in between.</p>
	<p>We get to choose from two problems. This year, there was a shipping problem which required you to find how many warehouses you need to have one-day ground shipping throughout the entire country and there was a triathlon problem which required you to organize a triathlon efficiently by using the data of athlete's given. My group chose to do the second problem.
	<a href="pdf/COMAP_6284_paper.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Here</a> is our paper with our solution and explanation for why we think it is the best solution.</p>
	<p>We also do a lot of labs in a program called Mathematica. Our teacher, 
	<a href="http://www.massacademy.org/regele.html" target="_blank" class="colorHover"> Mr. Regele</a> tries to incorporate technology with math. One of the labs assigned to us was a gas station problem. We had to do use the process of Math Modeling to solve it. 
	<a href="pdf/b_gasstation_2016.2017_sinha.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Here</a> is our lab. My group's HiMCM paper was also written in there.
