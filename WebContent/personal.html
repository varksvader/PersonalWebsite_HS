		<p>I am currently a senior at the
		<a href="http://massacademy.org/" target="_blank" class="colorHover"> Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI</a>.
		I live in Grafton, MA. My sending school is 
		<a href="http://www.graftonps.org/Domain/8" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Grafton High</a>.
		I have no siblings or pets, but this gives me more time to explore my interests. The reason why I came to Mass Academy is because I wanted to go in a STEM focused school. Since I was a kid, I always wanted to be an engineer, and Mass Academy gives me the opportunity to fulfill it.</p>

		<p>Most people describe me as a short Indian female who has a really high voice. I don't think this is true, but my classmates say otherwise. Although I look skinny and flimsy, I can assure that I can handle myself. My math teacher 
		<a href="http://www.massacademy.org/regele.html" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Mr. Regele</a>
		 said I will hurt people by doing math. So if there's an invader on the loose, get him or her to me and hopefully he or she will have a black eye by the end of my interpretation on Heron's proof.</p>
		<p>One of my favorite hobbies is hiking. When I was young, my parents and I would always travel to different parts of the country during my school vacations. I’ve been to the Smoky Mountains, Acadia, White Mountains, and many other mountain ranges. The tallest mountain I have climbed is Mount Washington when I was six years old, its height is 6,280 ft tall. This summer I went to Summer at Smith in Western Massachusetts, and climbed Mount Holyoke as pictured to the right. It was a fun experience although it was a very small mountain.</p>

		<p>Another one of my hobbies is playing the piano. I have been playing for 10 years at
		<a href="http://www.appletreearts.org/" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Apple Tree Arts</a>,
		located at the Grafton Common. I play many pieces like classical, jazz, contemporary, rock, Christmas Carols, and current pop music. My favorite classical composer is Mozart; I play his pieces often. I also play tennis. So far I’ve been on the varsity team for freshman and sophomore years, and hope to continue this year as well. I play in rotation for Second Doubles. I have lost some matches and won others. Whether I am good at it or not is questionable, but I have a lot fun being on the team. The girls are so nice and unique, it really gives me a chance to interact with people other than my friends. I guess you can say we’re like a tight knit family :)</p>

	<div><p>For community service this year, I participated at the <a href="http://bhcf.org/" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Community Barn</a> at Grafton, which is located in my hometown. I picked and packaged locally grown fruits and vegetables. I mostly picked summer squash and cucumbers.
	At school, I also participated in e-NABLE, a program that builds prosthetic hands for children who need them. The eight of us made 16 hands, each of which cost $16.58 exactly in comparison to the expensive prosthetics that can go up to the thousands. We built the hands by modeling them in SolidWorks and 3D printing them at school. 
	I am glad I did this project because it gave us insight on how our knowledge in science and technology helps other directly.</p>

		<p>Although I have received education of coding during class, I also enjoy learning new code techniques during my free time. The programming languages I know so far are Java, Python, HTML and CSS, Javascript, Swift, and C/C++. My coding enables me to code multiple things, from websites to microcontrollers. This summer I coded a Tic Tac Toe Artifical Intelligence using Arduino. It was very successful, even though I struggled to find all the algorithms where the computer wins. Because I had fun with that, I've decided to continue to tinker with Arduino.</p>
