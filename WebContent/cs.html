		teaches Computer Science at Mass Academy. Like many classes, Computer Science is divided into two levels. This leveling is based on how much Java you know. I am in the advanced level. We get different assignments than the rest of the class and work independently. One of the assignments we got was to calculate how many days you were alive. The following link is my code in a pdf. Please use a java environment to run my code if you choose to do so.

		<p>One project I did was with a partner. We made a program that converts speech-to-text. This project was fun to make and can be applied to almost anything. Maybe it can be an essay writer for someone who is to lazy to type, or it could be applied to lock things by using a special spoken password. We hope to add more to it.

		<p>Another project I did with a group was Apps for Good. Apps for Good is a program where teams of students build an app for a need. We decided to work in a new medium: virtual reality. We worked specifically
		with Daydream, developing an painting app. Our minimal viable product is a 360Ëš canvas, wide range of colors, and the ability to undo storkes. We also tried the act of saving the painting and painting by voice commands. However,
		there was not enough time to implement them. We are working on uploading our app to the Google Play Store this summer. To learn more about our project, please see our
