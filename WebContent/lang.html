	<p>Language is a class where you are only allowed to speak in the target language. The language I take is French, and I am in the Advanced class.

	teaches us the language through immersion. We listen to French music, watch French movies, read French books, and write essays in French. Currently, we are working on our films. I think making a film is the best part of the class. At the end of year, there will be a viewing of all our films.</p>
	<p>One of the things we did in class was read and watch "La Belle et La Bête," or commonly known as "Beauty and the Beast". As a disclaimer, we did not read or watch the Disney version, but the actual French version. The written version was by Beaumont and the film version was by Cocteau. After reading and watching it, we had to write a summary of a small part.

	<p>We also watched a lot of other fairy tales after Beauty and the Beast. After watching a few, we had to write our own fairy tales.
