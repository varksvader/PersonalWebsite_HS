	This class, unlike others, is more traditional. We get notes, homework, labs, tests, and quizzes. Physics is really interesting. Even though I took AP Physics last year, Mr. Ellis manages to teach me something new every unit. </p>
	<p>In this class, we have the option of doing Algebra-based physics or Calculus-based physics. Because of my previous background, I have decided to do the Calculus-based physics even though it is a little tricky. An example of my calculus work is my 
	<a href="pdf/ÜberProblemCalculusJerry.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Über Problem</a>. Mr. Ellis has given us two Über problems so far this year. An Über problem is a problem that has multiple steps and spans out to a couple of pages, hence its name.</p>
	<p>Also, like every science class, we do labs. One of the labs we did was investigating springs and spring constants.
