	<p>Humanities class is a combination of a not-so-average social studies class and a not-so-average English class. 
	<a href="http://www.massacademy.org/ludt.html" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Mr. Ludt</a>,
	our teacher, is quite a character, but his personality is what makes the class more enjoyable. He is a grammar enthusiast with a knack of growling at people who make grammar mistakes.</p>
	<p>This class not only analyzes literature, but also connects literary works to historical events. I like the way the class is taught because it gives context to the literature we are reading. So far in class, we have read Bradbury's short stories, Egyptian love (obsession) poems, the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Aeneid</i>, and we are currently reading Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
	The essays below are the essays I enjoyed writing.</p>
	<p>My <a href="pdf/EgyptianEssay.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Egyptian Essay</a> 
	analyzes the Egyptian love poems we read in class. I don't know how these poems were labeled as love when clearly one can tell it is obsession. My essay justifies why people are writing about their obsessions and traces it back to psychological distress. </p>
	<p>Another essay I wrote was my <a href="pdf/GreekEssay.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorHover">Greek Essay</a>.
	 This essay analyzes how women are portrayed in Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and Euripedes <i>Women of Troy</i> and are held to a standard. I use the characterizations of certain characters to show the standard forced on women by society is not achievable and should not be forced on women.</p>
